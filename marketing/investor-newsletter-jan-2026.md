Hi {{First Name}},

We've had a chance to connect previously about Arkova, and we wanted to keep you in the loop with concise monthly updates on how the company is progressing.

## Product & Technology

- **Core platform development 70% complete** — Authentication, onboarding, individual vaults, document anchoring, and organization admin features are all built and tested (65+ automated tests passing).

- **Document anchoring workflow implemented** — Browser-side SHA-256 fingerprinting ensures documents never leave the user's device. Confirmation flow, anchor detail views, and re-verification all functional.

- **Enterprise security foundations in place** — Row-level security on all tables, append-only audit logging, role immutability enforced at database level. SOC 2 Type II preparation underway.

- **LinkedIn presence gaining traction** — Growing engagement from compliance officers, legal professionals, and enterprise decision-makers. Building credibility in the verification infrastructure space.

Preliminary discussions underway with a veteran Sales Executive who has expressed interest in joining the team.

## Partnerships & Market

- **Finalizing advisory agreement with veteran CISO** — Adding enterprise security credibility and guidance as we prepare for SOC 2 and enterprise sales.
