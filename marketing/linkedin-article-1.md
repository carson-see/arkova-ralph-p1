# Your Digital Documents Have a Trust Problem

**And it's costing your company millions.**

Last year, a Fortune 500 company spent $4.2 million on a single audit. Not because they did anything wrong—but because proving they *didn't* requires an army of consultants reconstructing document timelines from scattered systems.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **most digital documents can't prove when they were created or whether they've been modified.**

Think about it. That contract you signed in 2019? The metadata can be changed. The file can be edited. The timestamp on your server can be manipulated. If someone challenged its authenticity in court, could you *prove* it's the original?

Most companies can't.

## The $600 Billion Problem

Credential fraud alone costs the global economy over $600 billion annually. Fake diplomas. Forged certifications. Doctored compliance reports.

And it's not just fraud. It's the *suspicion* of fraud that's expensive.

Every audit, every due diligence process, every regulatory review—they all require proving document authenticity. Without a reliable way to verify "this document existed on this date and hasn't changed," you're stuck in an endless cycle of manual verification.

## There's a Better Way

What if every important document had a tamper-evident timestamp? Not stored in your database (which can be compromised), but anchored to a public, immutable ledger that's been running continuously for 17 years.

No cryptocurrency required. No tokens. No speculation.

Just cryptographic proof that your document existed at a specific moment in time—proof that any third party can verify independently.

This is what **document anchoring** delivers:
- Instant verification for auditors and regulators
- Tamper-evident records that hold up in court
- Compliance evidence that doesn't require trusting your word

## The Bottom Line

The companies that solve the trust problem now will spend less on audits, close deals faster, and sleep better knowing their records are bulletproof.

The question isn't whether you need verifiable documents. It's whether you'll build that capability before your next audit—or after.
