Implement Backlog for Ralph — Priority 1 (Jan 2026), Section 1 — Bedrock (Schema + Constraints + RLS + Types + Seed + Docs) exactly as specified. This task builds the backend foundation only. Do NOT build product UI, flows, or pages beyond what is required to support schema, types, seed, tests, and documentation. Follow all directives: Tech Stack: React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, Lucide React, Supabase (Postgres + Auth), Zod (validation). File placement rules: src/ for app code, src/components/ui/ for shadcn components, src/components/ for app components, icons imported from lucide-react. Supabase config at supabase/config.toml, SQL migrations in supabase/migrations/, seed data in supabase/seed.sql, generated DB types in src/types/database.types.ts, type generation script in package.json (gen:types). Central UI copy strings in src/lib/copy.ts, copy lint script scripts/check-copy-terms.ts. Tests: unit tests in src/tests/ or src/__tests__/, RLS integration tests in tests/rls/, E2E in tests/e2e/. CI workflow in .github/workflows/ci.yml. Confluence-ready docs in docs/confluence/. Schema-first rule: define DB schema, enums, constraints, RLS before any dependent UI, generate database.types.ts from Supabase as UI contract, no mocked data objects once table exists. Security: RLS mandatory, tenant isolation enforced at DB, least privilege by default, no SECURITY DEFINER functions unless reviewed, secrets must not be committed, .env gitignored, CI blocks secrets. Timestamps: server-side timestamptz (UTC). Task sizing: each task completes in one round, all tasks have pass/fail Done when checks. Quality gates: repo passes typecheck, lint, tests after each task, maintain seed data, migrations reversible or have compensating docs. Documentation: produce Markdown docs ready for Confluence, update docs for schema/security/contract changes.\nTasks:\n1. Add Supabase bootstrap + migration scaffolding ... [continue all 18 tasks in same single line with \n between tasks]\nOutput [promise]BEDROCK_P1_COMPLETE[/promise] only when ALL success criteria are met. --max-iterations 50 --completion-promise "BEDROCK_P1_COMPLETE"
